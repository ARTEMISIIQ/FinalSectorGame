Game Title: Risky Racers
By: Ethan Tran

The files in this repository contain the source code for the game that I created, Risky Racers, for the Roosevelt Racers' "Roosevelt Dev Prix". 
To use the source code for either modifications or running the game, you must first have Unity Hub installed as this project was made with Unity.
You must create a git clone of this repository before going to the Unity Hub clicking on the arrow next to the ADD button and click "Add Project From Disk".
Then, select the git clone and you can open the game in the editor. Here, you can modify aspects of the game to your liking. If you wish to play the game
outside of the editor, you can select Build and Run and choose your device type (Make sure to have the build settings for your device downloaded). This will
create an application which you can play.

I had a really great time making this game and I hope that you all enjoy ;)!
