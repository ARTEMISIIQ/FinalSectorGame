Game Title: Risky Racers
By: Ethan Tran

The files in this repository contain the source code for the game that I created, Risky Racers, for the Roosevelt Racers' "Roosevelt Dev Prix". 
To use the source code for either modifications or running the game, you must first have Unity Hub installed as this project was made with Unity.
You need to download the repository as a ZIP before going to the Unity Hub clicking on the arrow next to the ADD button and click "Add Project From Disk".
Then, select the game and you can open it in the editor.

I had a really great time making this game and I hope that you all enjoy ;)!
